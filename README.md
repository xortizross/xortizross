## Hi there 👋

My name is Xochitl (pronounced só-chill 🏝️). Preferred pronouns: she/they  

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at UCLA in the [Blumstein Lab](https://blumsteinlab.eeb.ucla.edu). I am a behavioral ecologist studying the long-term consequences of early-life adversity in wild yellow-bellied marmots (check-out [my latest paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.14485)!) 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) lesson titled ["RRRRR... I'm stuck!"](https://github.com/kaijagahm/R-help-reprexes) that teaches learners how to troubleshoot their code and ask for help by creating minimal reproducible examples.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to collaborate on developing an open-source lesson using GitHub!
- 👯 We welcome collaborators and guinea pigs to test our lesson
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with anything and everything GitHub, I am so new at this
- 💬 Ask me about marmots
- 📫 How to reach me: xortizross@g.ucla.edu
